# Installation scripts
Installation scripts for linux (maybe Windows too?) for inital setup and software installation to start working.
Also some productivity scripts might be available

# Permissions
To be able to run the script you need to give permissions to the files using `chmod` command.
```
chmod +x [filename].sh
```
After doing this you will se an x in the permissions like `rwxrwxr-x`.

# Executing
Is possible in two ways: `sh script.sh` or `./script.sh`.
